//! A read-only data source's console: each statement is checked before it is sent, and runs
//! in the database's read-only mode, as `crate::read_only` describes.
//!
//! Where that mode is a transaction, one is opened before each statement and rolled back once
//! the statement is done: at once for most, or when the last of its rows is read (or dropped)
//! for one whose rows are still being paged through. The console's own transaction status
//! never sees it, so the console shows no open transaction and nothing asks to roll one back.
